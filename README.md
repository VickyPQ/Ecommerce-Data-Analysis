## Introduction

Maven Fuzzy Factory is an 8‑month‑old DTC e‑commerce start‑up that sells irresistibly cute *plush creatures*.\
<br>
The founding team is lean — a CEO, a Marketing Director, and a Website Manager — so the analyst (that's ME) sits **at the intersection of data and strategy**, turning raw click‑stream data into commercial moves that grow revenue and margin.\
<br>
As an aspiring analyst I rebuilt six of the questions I was routinely asked by C‑level and marketing leadership into a single, reproducible SQL portfolio. \
<br>
This project answers that call, end‑to‑end—**from raw tables to board‑ready insights**—showcasing advanced SQL techniques such as *pivoting with `CASE` & aggregate counts, window functions, multi‑step analyses with temporary tables & sub‑queries.*

## Database Description
*Schema:* `mavenfuzzyfactory`  (6 tables)  

| Table | Grain | Key Fields  |
|-------|-------|----------------------|
| `website_sessions` | One row per visit | `website_session_id`, `created_at`, `utm_source`, `utm_campaign`, `device_type`, `is_repeat_session` |
| `website_pageviews` | One pageview | `website_session_id`, `website_pageview_id`, `created_at`, `url` |

## Project Objectives

1. **Map** where visitors come from and how they convert → optimise marketing spend.
2. **De‑risk** the website experience → lift CVR by systematic A/B tests.
3. **Balance** the marketing channel portfolio → diversify away from a single SEM engine.
4. **Forecast & prepare** for demand swings using pattern & seasonality analysis.
5. **Expand** the product catalogue intelligently → track launch success + cross‑sell.
6. **Deepen** knowledge of user life‑cycle behaviour → unlock LTV growth.

<br>

## Analytical Roadmap
The storyline deliberately mirrors how an exec meeting unfolds—top‑down & action oriented:
1. **Traffic Resources** → Where do the eyeballs come from?  
2. **Website Performance** → What do those eyeballs *do*?  
3. **Channel Portfolio Management** → Are we spending the next \$1 in the right place?  
4. **Business Pattern & Seasonality** → When should we expect surges or lulls?  
5. **Product Analysis** → Which SKUs create or destroy margin?  
6. **User Analysis** → Are we retaining valuable customers?

### 1️⃣ Traffic Resource Analysis
| #   | Assignment                            | Business Lens                 |
| --- | ------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| 1.1 | Finding Top Traffic Sources      | Baseline channel mix          |
| 1.2 | Traffic‑Source Conversion Rates  | Economic viability            |
| 1.3 | Traffic‑Source Trending           | Seasonality & cannibalisation |
| 1.4 | Bid Optimisation for Paid Traffic | Device‑level ROI              |
| 1.5 | Trending with Granular Segments   | Intersectional insights       |


#### 1.1.Finding Top Traffic Sources
```sql
USE mavenfuzzyfactory;

SELECT
    utm_source,
    utm_campaign,
    http_referer,
    COUNT(website_session_id) AS sessions
FROM website_sessions
WHERE created_at < '2012-04-12'
GROUP BY 1,2,3
ORDER BY sessions DESC;
```
**Output** 
| utm_source | utm_campaign | http_referer              | sessions |
|------------|--------------|---------------------------|----------|
| gsearch    | nonbrand     | https://www.gsearch.com   | 3613     |
| (null)     | (null)       | https://www.gsearch.com   | 28       |
| (null)     | (null)       | https://gsearch.com       | 27       |
| gsearch    | brand        | https://www.gsearch.com   | 26       |
| bsearch    | brand        | https://www.bsearch.com   | 7        |
| (null)     | (null)       | https://www.bsearch.com   | 7        |


> **Insight →** The gsearch nonbrand campaign is the top-performing traffic source with 3613 sessions, accounting for the vast majority of incoming traffic.

> **Next move →** We should deep‑dive gsearch nonbrand.
---
#### 1.2. Gsearch Nonbrand Conversion Rate
```sql
SELECT
    COUNT(DISTINCT website_sessions.website_session_id) AS sessions,
    COUNT(DISTINCT orders.order_id) AS orders
FROM website_sessions
LEFT JOIN orders
    ON orders.website_session_id = website_sessions.website_session_id
WHERE website_sessions.created_at < '2012-04-14'
  AND utm_source = 'gsearch'
  AND utm_campaign = 'nonbrand';
```
**Output**

| sessions | orders | session_to_order_conv_rt |
|----------|--------|---------------------------|
| 3895     | 112    | 0.0288                    |


> **Insight →** The conversion rate from session to order for the gsearch nonbrand campaign is **2.88%**, which is below the 4% threshold needed to justify current bid costs.

> **Next move →** We should monitor the impact of reduced bids and analyze device-level performance trends to inform future bid strategy adjustments.
---
#### 1.3. Gsearch Nonbrand Volume Trends (Traffic‑Source Trending)

```sql
USE mavenfuzzyfactory;

SELECT
    MIN(DATE(created_at)) AS week_start_date,
    COUNT(DISTINCT website_sessions.website_session_id) AS sessions
FROM website_sessions
WHERE website_sessions.created_at < '2012-05-10'
  AND website_sessions.utm_source = 'gsearch'
  AND website_sessions.utm_campaign = 'nonbrand'
GROUP BY YEARWEEK(website_sessions.created_at);
```



**Output**

| week_start_date | sessions |
|------------------|----------|
| 2012-03-19       | 896      |
| 2012-03-25       | 956      |
| 2012-04-01       | 1152     |
| 2012-04-08       | 983      |
| 2012-04-15       | 621      |
| 2012-04-22       | 594      |
| 2012-04-29       | 681      |
| 2012-05-06       | 399      |



> **Insight →** After the bid reduction on April 15, gsearch nonbrand session volume noticeably declined, with weekly sessions dropping from 983 to 621 and continuing downward to 399 by early May.

> **Next move →** We should continue tracking weekly volume and explore strategies to make campaigns more efficient, so that we can increase volume again without increasing bids.
---
#### 1.4. Gsearch Device-Level Performance (Bid Optimisation for Paid Traffic)

```sql
SELECT
    website_sessions.device_type,
    COUNT(DISTINCT website_sessions.website_session_id) AS sessions,
    COUNT(DISTINCT orders.order_id) AS orders,
    COUNT(DISTINCT orders.order_id) / COUNT(DISTINCT website_sessions.website_session_id) AS conv_rt
FROM website_sessions
LEFT JOIN orders
    ON orders.website_session_id = website_sessions.website_session_id
WHERE website_sessions.created_at < '2012-05-11'
  AND utm_source = 'gsearch'
  AND utm_campaign = 'nonbrand'
GROUP BY 1;
```



**Output**

| device_type | sessions | orders | conv_rt |
|-------------|----------|--------|---------|
| desktop     | 3911     | 146    | 0.0373  |
| mobile      | 2492     | 24     | 0.0096  |



> **Insight →** Conversion rates on desktop (3.73%) significantly outperform mobile (0.96%), indicating that desktop users are far more likely to complete a purchase.

> **Next move →** We should increase bids for desktop traffic to drive more volume from this high-converting segment, and monitor performance by device type to assess the impact of bid adjustments.

---

#### 1.5. Gsearch Device-Level Weekly Trends (Trending with Granular Segments)

```sql
SELECT
    MIN(DATE(created_at)) AS week_start_date,
    COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN device_type = 'desktop' THEN website_sessions.website_session_id ELSE NULL END) AS dtop_sessions,
    COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN device_type = 'mobile' THEN website_sessions.website_session_id ELSE NULL END) AS mob_sessions
FROM website_sessions
WHERE website_sessions.created_at < '2012-06-09'
  AND website_sessions.created_at >= '2012-04-15'
  AND website_sessions.utm_source = 'gsearch'
  AND website_sessions.utm_campaign = 'nonbrand'
GROUP BY YEARWEEK(website_sessions.created_at);
```



**Output**

| week_start_date | dtop_sessions | mob_sessions |
|------------------|---------------|--------------|
| 2012-04-15       | 383           | 238          |
| 2012-04-22       | 360           | 234          |
| 2012-04-29       | 425           | 256          |
| 2012-05-06       | 430           | 282          |
| 2012-05-13       | 403           | 214          |
| 2012-05-20       | 661           | 190          |
| 2012-05-27       | 585           | 183          |
| 2012-06-03       | 582           | 157          |


> **Insight →** After the desktop bid increase on May 19, desktop session volume surged from 403 to 661 the following week, while mobile traffic remained relatively flat or declined, confirming a positive response to the bid strategy.

> **Next move →** We should continue monitoring device-level traffic and conversion performance to ensure bid levels are driving the right results and optimizing budget efficiency.

| /billing                   | 716      |
| /thank-you-for-your-order | 306      |



> **Insight →** The homepage, products page, and the Mr. Fuzzy product page account for the majority of total session volume, highlighting their importance as primary user touchpoints.

> **Next move →** Investigate whether these top-viewed pages are also leading entry pages, and assess each page’s performance to identify any areas for UX or conversion improvement.

---
#### 2.2. Top Entry Pages 

```sql
USE mavenfuzzyfactory;

CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE first_pageviews AS
SELECT
    website_session_id,
    MIN(website_pageview_id) AS min_pageview_id
FROM website_pageviews
WHERE created_at < '2012-06-12'
GROUP BY website_session_id;

SELECT
    website_pageviews.pageview_url AS landing_page_url,
    COUNT(first_pageviews.website_session_id) AS sessions_hitting_page
FROM first_pageviews
LEFT JOIN website_pageviews
    ON website_pageviews.website_pageview_id = first_pageviews.min_pageview_id
GROUP BY website_pageviews.pageview_url;
```


**Output**

| landing_page_url | sessions_hitting_page |
|------------------|------------------------|
| /home            | 10,711                 |

---

> **Insight →** The homepage is currently the dominant entry point for nearly all user sessions, which suggests it's the first impression for most visitors and a crucial focus area for optimization.

> **Next move →** Analyze homepage performance in detail to ensure it delivers a strong first experience, and consider whether it’s truly the best entry point for all user journeys.

---
#### 2.3. Bounce Rate Analysis

```sql
USE mavenfuzzyfactory;

-- Step 1: Identify first pageview per session
CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE first_pageviews AS
SELECT
    website_session_id,
    MIN(website_pageview_id) AS min_pageview_id
FROM website_pageviews
WHERE created_at < '2012-06-14'
GROUP BY website_session_id;

-- Step 2: Filter sessions landing on the homepage
CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE sessions_w_home_landing_page AS
SELECT
    first_pageviews.website_session_id,
    website_pageviews.pageview_url AS landing_page
FROM first_pageviews
LEFT JOIN website_pageviews
    ON website_pageviews.website_pageview_id = first_pageviews.min_pageview_id
WHERE website_pageviews.pageview_url = '/home';

-- Step 3: Identify sessions that only viewed one page (bounced)
CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE bounced_sessions AS
SELECT
    sessions_w_home_landing_page.website_session_id,
    sessions_w_home_landing_page.landing_page,
    COUNT(website_pageviews.website_pageview_id) AS count_of_pages_viewed

    COUNT(DISTINCT sessions_w_home_landing_page.website_session_id) AS sessions,
    COUNT(DISTINCT bounced_sessions.website_session_id) AS bounced_sessions,
    COUNT(DISTINCT bounced_sessions.website_session_id) * 1.0 /
    COUNT(DISTINCT sessions_w_home_landing_page.website_session_id) AS bounce_rate
FROM sessions_w_home_landing_page
LEFT JOIN bounced_sessions
    ON sessions_w_home_landing_page.website_session_id = bounced_sessions.website_session_id;
```

**Output**

| sessions | bounced_sessions | bounce_rate |
|----------|------------------|-------------|
| 11044    | 6536             | 0.5918      |



> **Insight →** Nearly 60% of homepage entry sessions result in a bounce, indicating users are leaving the site without exploring further—this is unusually high for paid search traffic and suggests room for UX improvements.

> **Next move →** Build and test a dedicated landing page tailored for search visitors, then track whether it lowers bounce rate compared to the homepage.

> **Insight →** Traffic was correctly split during the test, and eventually shifted entirely to `/lander-1`. Importantly, the **overall bounce rate trended downward**, validating the success of the custom landing page.

> **Next move →** Maintain close monitoring to ensure performance stays strong and look for other optimization opportunities now that this one is validated.

You're right — thanks for your patience! Here's the correct markdown for **2.7. Conversion Funnel Test Results**, based on the screenshot and assignment context:

#### 2.7. Conversion Funnel Test Results

```sql
USE mavenfuzzyfactory;

-- STEP 0: Find the first time /billing-2 was seen to determine test start point
SELECT
    MIN(website_pageviews.created_at) AS first_created_at,
    MIN(website_pageviews.website_pageview_id) AS first_pv_id
FROM website_pageviews
WHERE pageview_url = '/billing-2';

-- STEP 1: Get sessions hitting either /billing or /billing-2 after test began
SELECT
    billing_version_seen,
    COUNT(DISTINCT website_session_id) AS sessions,
    COUNT(DISTINCT order_id) AS orders,
    COUNT(DISTINCT order_id) * 1.0 / COUNT(DISTINCT website_session_id) AS billing_to_order_rt
FROM (
    SELECT
        website_pageviews.website_session_id,
        website_pageviews.pageview_url AS billing_version_seen,
        orders.order_id
    FROM website_pageviews
    LEFT JOIN orders
        ON website_pageviews.website_session_id = orders.website_session_id
    WHERE website_pageviews.website_pageview_id >= 53550         -- test start pageview_id
      AND website_pageviews.created_at >= '2012-11-10'           -- assignment date
      AND website_pageviews.pageview_url IN ('/billing', '/billing-2')
) AS billing_sessions_w_orders
GROUP BY billing_version_seen;
```

**Output**

| billing_version_seen | sessions | orders | billing_to_order_rt |
|-----------------------|----------|--------|----------------------|
| /billing              | 657      | 300    | 0.4566               |
| /billing-2            | 654      | 410    | 0.6269               |

> **Insight →** The new billing page **/billing-2** clearly performs better, increasing the conversion rate from **45.66% to 62.69%** — a significant improvement.

> **Next move →** Now that the new billing page proves more effective, work with Engineering to roll it out fully and continue monitoring performance metrics.
